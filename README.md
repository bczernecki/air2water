# air2water

The problem with running air2water model beyond calibration period...

Model shows almost no skill in simulating lake surface water temperature (LSWT) after year 2000 (2001-2015 set as validation period)

Simulation input and output files provided in folders entitled with the name of lakes (Lubie, Studzieniczne, Charzykowskie, Mikolajskie, Gardno, Selmet, Hancza, Selmet.Wielki, Sepolenskie, Jeziorak, Slawskie)

Input parameters established with the provided Matlab code according to the mean depth of lake (as given in the pre_processing folder)

Below some diagnostic plots obtained with the code included in the file verify.R:

[Lake Hancza - Calibration - (1972-2000) - looks good](hancza_calibration.png)
[Lake Hancza - Validation - (2001-2015) - almost no skill](hancza_validation.png)
