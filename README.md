# air2water

The problem with running air2water model beyond calibration period... 
Model shows almost no skill in simulating lake surface water temperature (LSWT) after year 2000

Simulation files are provided in the folders entitle with the name of each of lakes (Lubie, Studzieniczne, Charzykowskie, Mikolajskie, Gardno, Selmet, Hancza, Selmet.Wielki, Sepolenskie, Jeziorak, Slawskie)

Parameters established with the provided Matlab code according to the mean depth of lake (as given in the pre_processing folder)

Below some diagnostic plots obtained with the code included in the file verify.R:
